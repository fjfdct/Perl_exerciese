1. Machine codes are for computers, while source code for humans. 
2. "Byte-compiled" languages Perl and Java.
3. Perl compiler: translate source codes into native machine ones, and run the latter.
4. Bytecode: used in a "virtual machine"-pretended program, source code -(compiler)- bytecode -(interpreter)- machine code.
So Perl is strictly neither a compiled language nor interpreted one.
5. CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network): http://www.perl.com/CPAN/
